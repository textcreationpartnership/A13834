            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MONG</hi> all the wonders which haue happened on earth ſince the myſteries of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, what more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous, more wonderfull, &amp; profitable to man, than to haue an infallible refuge and harbour of ſecurity, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fury and ſtorme of the diuine wrath, where he may be deliuered from the imminent blow of that dreadfull ſword, which perceth with ſo great woe, as the extreme and inſufferable paine which it cauſeth, can neuer be mitigated, nor in any ſorte abated, but rather more and more increaſed: as by meditating, conſidering, and reading the holy Scriptures, it is playne to all, that can conceiue the misfortunate ſtate of ſinners. VVhich is the chance of all that dy the children of wrath, and are plunged into the fiery pittes of damnation, bycauſe they did not ſuccour themſelues in their life on earth, in the harbour of Gods vnſpeakable mercies: which very ſpecially do appeare at his beloued <hi>Loreto,</hi> the precinct, the walls, and the circuite of that Paradiſe, where Chriſt our Lord was not only made man, and
<pb facs="tcp:19095:10"/>the Sauiour of our ſoules: but alſo the ſentence of malediction was taken from the damned poſterity of Adam, and happily changed into the former benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. If that the place where our firſt Father was created, was the delight and ioy of man; yf the place where the ſentence of death was pronounced againſt vs, were holden of ſuch wonder, eſtimation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that no wordes can declare it: what I pray thee ought that to be, where Chriſt himſelf was framed of our nature; where in ſteed of damnation, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was brought from heauen and giuen to all well deſeruing people? VVhich was not made the barre, the tribunall, and the throne of the rigorous and ſeuere iudgment of our death, but the Paradiſe, the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and the ſacred Fountaine, where that heauenly ſalue was made, that cureth the grieued woundes of our manifold ſinnes. If Allmighty God deſtroied the former Paradiſe, as the place of our damnation, and by a miracle vnheard of from the beginning of the world, hath preſerued this in the very ſame ſtate, wherin it was, when he himſelf was there made man: can any imagine, dare any ſay, will any iudge that it is for no end? This ſpeciall wonder was for ſome greate purpoſe, as indeed the meruailous, the dayly, and the manifold benefits beſtowed there on mankinde, by the praier of the immaculate Mother of our God, do vndoubtedly declare; yea and do ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify to all, that God, Allmighty hath made this a very ſpeciall harbour of refuge and ſuccour vnto vs,
<pb facs="tcp:19095:11"/>in the manifold dangers of our earthly peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which not only many thouſands of ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wonders, wholy ſurpaſsing the power of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall meanes, but alſo the incredible deuotion of all Chriſtians, doth acknowledge, teſtify, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue the ſame, with more effectuall zeale, than any words can deliuer to the godlieſt Reader: in ſo much indeed, that they who haue not ſeene &amp; taſted this wherof I ſpeake, at firſt will not ſo eaſily belieue to be true. For the like concourſe, the like feruour, and ſuch continuall deuotion, was neuer heard of from the beginning of the world. And what is the cauſe of all this ſo great feruour and reuerence? The reuiuing of dead men? the curiug of diſeaſes, that by naturall meanes were vtterly deſpaired of, and paſt all hope of cure? the heauenly viſions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations, which haue beene shewed to deuout people in this moſt Maieſticall Seate of the whole world? No, no, not only theſe, but chiefly the aboundance of Gods grace, the Fountaine of heauenly ioy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, which ſeemeth ſtill to flow, and to be powred into mens harts beyond all meaſure in this celeſtiall place: which is ſo euident and ſo manifeſt, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> heauen. Seing therfore that theſe things are ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the very enemies of the Chriſtian name
<pb facs="tcp:19095:11"/>neither do, nor can deny them: what will they ſay, who deny that Saintes can heare our prayers? That their ſacred Reliques can worke any effect aboue nature? VVhat anſwere will they frame and shape to this? VVell may they blush and be much ashamed, to haue denied, hated, contemned, and reiected Chriſt himſelf, by reiecting theſe things with ſuch malicious contempt and hatred? But what? can any anſwere be made to the inſcrutable iudgments of Allmighty God, who doth worke thus meruailouſly by the things, which he and his B. Mother touched and ſanctified by their owne habitation, whiles they liued on earth? If in the old Law, allmighty God did worke theſe and ſuch like wonders, in the Pond vpon Probatica (Ioan. <hi>5.</hi>) which he neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be made, either for the cure of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, or for people to reſorte vnto it, for that, or any other end, but approoued their deuotion and godly reuerence by miracles from heauen: will he then be leſſe beneficiall to Chriſtians in the new law, than to the Iewes in the old? Or will he do leſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Reliques of his deere Saintes, than to the waters which only washt the ſacrifices of the old Law? Or haue people leſſe need of theſe things now, than at thoſe times they had? Or be there not now as many diſeaſes in the new, as before in the old Law? VVhy therfore should not Chriſt beſtow benefits on his beloued in this and in other places, by the merits of his B. Mother? VVhy should not diſeaſes be cured in this
<pb facs="tcp:19095:12"/>deuout Houſe before the Image of our B. Lady now a dayes, aſwell as in the waters of that Pond, in the tyme of the former people? Is Chriſt power leſſe now in his owne Houſe, than in tyme paſt in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that place? But why by more wordes should I ſeeke to prooue and declare the poſsibility of Gods grace &amp; power, which ſo admirably, ſo comfortably, and moſt merueilouſly doth not only shew it ſelf; but alſo doth flow into mens ſoules in the ſacred Houſe of <hi>Loreto:</hi> that by his holy Conception and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there, Chriſt our Lord doth ſeeme to haue made it the gate of heauen, for our comfort and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ioy. Haue not all nations Chriſtian by their vowes, votaries, gifts and donaries approoued and moſt religiouſly deſired to taſt (as indeed they haue) of the ſweetnes of <hi>Loreto?</hi> And which is more, do not heathenish nations admire and confeſſe the diuine power, which allwaies is ſo preſent there, that to them it ſeemeth as it were to dwell in the moſt ſacred Houſe of <hi>Loreto?</hi> All <hi>Barbary</hi> is full of the reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of <hi>Loreto,</hi> and doth tremble to heare the name of Mary of <hi>Loreto</hi> mentioned, whome many times that country-people thinking to haue robbed &amp; ſpoiled of her wealth, were taught by many great miracles, and infinite loſſe of men, not to touch, nor approach vnto her, but to reuerence and honour her with reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious reſpect and deuout wordes. Only England of all nations vnder the ſunne doth not know, doth not honour and reuerence this glorious Paradiſe of the
<pb facs="tcp:19095:12"/>earth. VVhat, is she worſe than Turkes and heathen people, who dare not attempt any hoſtility, nor vtter any irreuerent thing of <hi>Loreto,</hi> being taught this fruitfull leſſon by their great harme? Truly for that preſumptuouſnes, which maketh thee O En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland to ſay that Saints cannot heare our praiers, that Mary the Mother of Chriſt is no better than other women, that she can not heare, nor help her Suppliants. But if the Catholicke Church can not teach thee, if Turkes, if heathenish people cannot informe thee; let wonderfull workes of God, this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of the world, the meruailous benefits beſtowed on mankinde in this moſt ſacred place by the praiers of the Mother of God, make it manifeſt vnto thee, that Chriſt doth heare his Mothers praiers, and that the contrary, irreuerent, impious, and blaſphemous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion doth bring da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation of body &amp; ſoule to all thoſe that belieue ſuch fancies &amp; diuellish inuentions, as to contemne, to deride, &amp; to detract the Saintes of All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: wheras the contrary, that is, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to reuerence, and by humble praier to intreate the help, the aſsiſtance, and the aid of his Saintes, is ſo pleaſing, acceptable, and deere in the ſight of his diuine Maieſty, that he doth confirme this beliefe of his Catholike ſeruants with dayly &amp; innumerable miracles from heauen: wherby the contrary is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, deteſted &amp; hated by Allm.

O what increaſe of vertue will come to your ſoules, to thinke that B.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING</hi> now a long time donne my endeuour to vnfold from the beginning to our age, the Hiſtory of the houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> which many haue rather begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne then fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and moſt earneſtly deſired: I pray God as the worke hath beene difficult and painfull, ſo it may be profitable. For almoſt all the monuments of this Hiſtory, which are to be found of
<pb facs="tcp:19095:17"/>
                  <hi>Loreto, Recanati, Rome,</hi> or els-where, haue beene peruſed with great labour and diligence; out of which I haue gathered, and ſo digeſted, whatſoeuer ſeemed to appertaine to this matter, that they might make one reaſonable volume. And the ſolicitude of the ſucceſſe, made the care of this preſent worke the greater. For no ſmall, nor few thinges to be ſpoken of, did occurre vnto me, as I was about to enter into it, to diſanimate &amp; auert my mind, from that which I purpoſed. And firſt truely the very beginnings of this ſacred Chappell are ſo admirable and ſo vnuſuall, that they may ſeeme almoſt incredible, if the iudgements of Almighty God were to be weighed by humane reaſon. Then the indiligence of our forefathers in committing ſuch things to writing, hath diminished a good parte of this Hiſtory. Beſides, it ſeemed a ſpice of arrogancie, to hope for better eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in a thing which many writers of no ſmall accompt had aſſaied with no good ſucceſſe. And laſt of all my owne diſabilitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to accuſe me; leſt I might be thought to haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſo weighty a worke, with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confidence then iudgement; being ſpecially to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe thoſe thinges, which becauſe they ſeeme in a ſort incredible, by diſcourſing might be made leſſe then they be indeed. VVherupon it was to be feared, that I might rather withdraw, then adde any thing to the worthy fame of this moſt Sacred Church, and with my loſt labour might purchaſe nothing els, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the wiſe. But when I had recollected my
<pb facs="tcp:19095:17"/>ſelfe, my mind was animated, and difficulties ceaſed. For although the thing be admirable, and neuer heard of before: yet now it is knowne to be ſo certaine, and manifeſt, as to controue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe or doubt therof, were wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes. For being receiued of our forefathers, as it were, from hand to hand, with great fidelitie; euen ſo did they deliuer it to poſteritie. VVhich is not grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the monuments of the <hi>Sclauonians,</hi> and of <hi>Recanati</hi> onely, but alſo on the authority of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers, and of the Roman Bishops. Alſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant conſent of ſo many Ages, and the concourſe of all nations, hath confirmed the auncient reporte hereof. Beſides, the incredible multitude, as well of Vowes, as the aboundance of Donaries, make the religion of the place moſt illuſtrious. And finally the old Miracles of this moſt Sacred Houſe, do not more beautifie the ſame; then the new ones daily do: that none may doubt of a thing ſo witneſſed and knowne, vnleſſe he will either doubt of the power and prouidence of God, or take away from mankind humane fidelitie. And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if we shew, that the beginings of this moſt Sacred Church, ennobled with the birth of the B. Virgin, and with the Conception of God, are far more maieſticall then others, all nations muſt allow that ſpeciall grace, with no leſſe willingnes, then they approoue the ſpeciall helpe therof. And albeit the indiligence of our fore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, hath bereaued vs of the fulnes of many thinges; yet it hath not depriued vs of the ſubſtance of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt matter, who not regarding ſmall things, shewed
<pb facs="tcp:19095:18"/>them ſelues diligent in greater. Therfore if this my ſimple preſent, shall be acceptable to the B. Virgin, (as I hope it will) truely I miſtruſt not, but that the reſt will be facill &amp; expedite vnto me. For when <hi>MARY</hi> aſſiſteth, nothing can ſucceed amiſſe. But if perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture this my labour be not anſwerable, either to the greatnes of the thing, almoſt incredible, or els to the expectation of the learned; truely it shall be my contentment, to haue donne my vttermoſt endeuour, to perpetuate the memory of ſo famous a miracle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glory of the B. Virgin mother of God, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of mankind, and euen the inflamed deſire of all godly people. And vnleſſe the affection of this preſent worke deceiue me, there is ſcarce any Hiſtory of this kind, more famous for miracles, richer for examples, more frequent for practice, or pleaſanter for profit. For heere may you behold the diuers and manifold protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the B. Virgin of <hi>Loreto.</hi> Here her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent helpe in all manner of dangers: here moſt of her miracles &amp; wonders, laid before you in a worthy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence you may intreate helpe for your ſelfe, for your familie and Cittie; for the diuerſitie of times as need shall require. And to me truely <hi>Italy</hi> ſeemeth to haue a great pledge of Gods beneuolence, to the which, euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Galiley</hi> it ſelfe, was ſent ſo rare and ſo great a gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t; that in time of aduerſuie she may hope, that she shall neuer wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t her patronage, whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Houſe she enioyeth as a ſuertie &amp; baile from God himſelfe. Moreouer Almightie God hath inſpired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:19095:18"/>the hartes of mortall men, ſuch deuotion towards the place, that whoſoeuer come to the houſe of <hi>Loreto</hi> ſeeme not ſo much to come to the houſe of the Virgin, as to the B. Virgin herſelfe. For heere in very deed, both Almightie God and his B. mother, declare their preſence, after a certaine marueilous manner: Hence is ſtroken that diuine feare into the hartes of all, at their very entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into this moſt Sacred Houſe: Hence commeth that deſire to them that are to depart from it, to reuiſit it againe: Hence that notable mutation of deſperate and notorious wicked mindes to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. VVhich continuall miracles of the Houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> are ſo euident, that albeit others were wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as they abound, yet theſe alone might make ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proofe to any creature, of the preſence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God in ſo much that there is none (though deſperat &amp; wicked) but if he viſit the houſe of <hi>Loreto</hi> may not eaſily perceiue Almightie God to be preſent with his B. Mother, in his Mothers litle Houſe. This is ſpeciall and proper to the Church of <hi>Loreto,</hi> to haue her religion and ſanctitie to florish euery day more and more, which may eaſily appeare in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of other famous Churches, either of our B. Lady or els of other Saints. For when their celebritie and reuerence hath florished for a certaine time, we know that it hath diminished by litle and litle: but by the ſpace of ſo many ages, we euidently ſee, that becauſe the maieſtie of this Church, is grounded on moſt firme foundations, it doth daily become more glorious and
<pb facs="tcp:19095:19"/>more holy. VVherfore Almightie God, and his B. Mother aſſiſting vs, of whom this whole worke doth intreate, and on whoſe helpe we moſt relie; we will now beginne the Hiſtory it ſelfe, which truely through their gracious fauour, will not be ſo painfull I hope vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the writer, as profitable vnto the reader. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the beginning of the Houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> be ſcarce deriued aboue three hundred yeares; yet neceſſarily muſt it be deduced higher, that the whole diſcourſe may more purely flow, from the head and fountaine it ſelfe.</p>

But what religion, what care, what reuerence of any people whatſoeuer can be anſwerable to that heauenly and moſt excellent gift? If this were the cauſe, why ſhe changed her ſeat, wherſoeuer ſhe is ſeated, forthwith ſhe may well change her ſeat againe. This and ſuch like moane they all made, for the departure of it, which the preſent feeling and griefe of their loſſe ſuggeſted vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not eaſie for the writer to relate. Finally being ouercome with weariſomnes, rather then with the ſatietie of lamenting, they went ſwarming to <hi>Frangipane</hi> the Pretor, and there againe renewing their wayling, they asked of him aduiſe and helpe. And though he him ſelfe did need comfort, as wounded with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon griefe, &amp; more ſorowfull the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was fitting for his part; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he ouercame him ſelfe, and diſſembling his ſorrow, aſſwaged the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they came vnto it, they went into the Houſe it ſelfe, and aſſoone as they had paſſed the threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old, a great dread came ſuddainly vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but preſently being repleniſhed with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnwonted ſweetnes, they ſpent the night deuoutly in prayer, dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly viewing whatſoeuer was vnder the roofe.

               <p>Doubtles therfore it was brought from ſome other place by miracle, or ſent from heauen it ſelfe.

The neerer their hope was of approaching vnto it, the more the multitude of the concurrents, &amp; their deſire to ſee it increaſed: ſo that, when the moſt Sacred Houſe (which all this

Wherfore aſſoone as this light of Gods li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie ſhewed it ſelfe to the people of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canati,</hi> with ſtriuing emulation they began to reuerence and adorne the Cell of the <hi>B.

From whence ruſhing forth, they tooke the Pilgrimes as they went vnto it, ſett on them vnawares, robbed them of their money and cloathes, yea and of their liues alſo, if ſo be they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by force. Wherby in ſhort ſpace all that Wood being infeſted and notoriouſly reproached with robberies and murders, was reduced to a wildernes, by reaſon that the Pilgrimes were frighted thence: and the reuerence and deuotion of this holy place waxing daily leſſe and leſſe, the moſt ſacred Houſe it ſelfe departed thence. For Almightie God thinking it an indignitie, that the malice of the infernall enemie ſhould turne to the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mankind, the refuge which he had prouided for their ſaluation; he choſe a ſafer and a fitter ſeat for Pilgrimes, for his owne, and his B. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers little Houſe.

But the wood being lately cutt downe, &amp; the land made arable, this exceeding pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therof was ſo ſpoiled by the rude huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen with diging and ſowing, that it vtterly decayed. Yet to preſerue the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the place, in thoſe very impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the ſaid <hi>Riera</hi> raiſed little low walles, both for a monument to poſteritie, that the ſacred Houſe of <hi>Loreto</hi> had in time paſt beene there, as alſo for a defence againſt the abuſes of cattle and ſimple men. I my ſelfe ſaw and viewed this place, when I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted theſe thinges to writing, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued that the parcell of ground incloſed within thoſe walles was euery way anſwerable, both in length and breadth, to the Houſe of <hi>Loreto.</hi> But now it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeather like to the other ground there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about; hauing loſt the exceeding pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19095:48"/>which it had, before the rude husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men violated the ſanctitie of the place: yet truely it hath ſo loſt the ſweetnes, that it retaineth the religion. For at this day it is viſited of many for deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſake, &amp; would alſo be viſited of more, but that the place is vnknowne to the common people. In time paſt when it was more knowne, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon of the exceeding pleaſantnes or better commoditie of the wayes, it was wont to be ſo reuerenced of the Pilgrimes, that none almoſt would belieue, that he had viſited the Cell of the B.

Now the place is altogeather vnfrequented &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paſſage, neither hath it a knowne way vnto it, ſo that if any will viſit it, he hath need of a skilfull guide. It is diſtant from the towne of <hi>Loreto</hi> almoſt a mile, and as much alſo from the ſea, not ſo much right on, as by many turnings.

But in the hill of the two Brothers, the ſignes are more obſcure; for that hill was leuelled to fill vp the valleys to make them commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for bulding, and alſo built vpon when the towne of <hi>Loreto</hi> was built, yet the place, or rather a ſigne therof remaineth. For without the walles of ſome priuate houſes, there is a certaine rude and a round peece of a hill, like to a bound-marke, which is graced with a little houſe, being now the only ſigne of the ſeate that our B. Lady made choiſe of there, and forſooke againe. The houſe wherunto this bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke is ioyned, being ſituated not farre from the gate of the Biſhops Pallace on the right hand as we enter, is as it were the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell or midſt of the towne of <hi>Loreto.</hi> And if that part of the Biſhops Pallace which is already begunne be continued, it will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie

For in his quiet reſt in the night time, he learned by a heauenly viſion, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Houſe of the B.

               <p>His gift was ſo pleaſing to the B. Virgin, that the hope of <hi>Pius</hi> the Pope deceiued him not any iote at all.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19095:79"/>ſicknes and age. Wherupon <hi>Pius</hi> vnwilling to delay the time (though he had not yet recouered perfect ſtrength) vndertooke his iourney towards <hi>Ancona,</hi>

In this iourney the neerer the Pope came to the Houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> the better he felt him ſelfe, that it might plainly appeare how he recouered his ſtrength: For when he came to preſent him ſelfe before the B.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19095:80"/>before the B.

But the delay of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the ſacred warre, was the only hinderance, that he receiued no ſuch bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt as he deſired, by the vow which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the interceſſion of the B. Virgin of <hi>Loreto.</hi> For being more and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired with age and feeblenes, and fitting at <hi>Ancona</hi> in all the ſummer heates, expecting the <hi>Venetian</hi> fleet, and other confederates of the warre, he began to pine away, either ouer-wearied with their delay, or els with old age oppreſſing his feeble body, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with falling into a gentle and a continuall feuer, he was at laſt conſumed, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to heauen to receiue the reward of his labours, &amp; of that moſt worthy endeuour, the 66. yeare of that age, deſeruing worthy remembrance as well for his notable giftes of mind, as for his pietie and religion.

A wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing to be ſpoken, the Queene of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen herſelfe brought the little maid to the Houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> thirtie miles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that place, and when ſhe had repleniſhed her with great ioy, at the ſight of her Image and of her Houſe, ſhe brought her backe againe to her ſheepe. Whereupon <hi>Alexandra</hi> had a great deſire to ſee that place &amp; ſight againe (though ſhe was ignorant what the Houſe and Virgin was:) for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the taſted ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> once entred into her minde, with flowing teares ſhe neuer ceaſed to intreat and importune <hi>Sabine</hi> her father to bring her to that houſe which ſhined with ſo many lightes (for otherwiſe ſhe could not deſcribe the place) where that moſt beautifull Virgin dwelt. The father ieſted at his daughters requeſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinking it to be a childiſh toy, or els ignorant what place ſhe deſcribed: but not long after it happened, that <hi>Sabine</hi> with his familie pilgrimaging to <hi>Loreto, Alexandra</hi> ſtraight acknowledged the place, trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed and exulted for ioy; &amp; turning to her father; Behold father, ſaid ſhe, this is the houſe, whither that moſt beautifull Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, cloathed in white brought me: hither
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19095:106"/>I deſired to returne, and this is the ſight that I was ſo willing to enioy againe. Wherat the father was amazed, but ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in his mind the exceeding deuotion of his daughter to the mother of God, he perceyued that ſhe was deare to the B.

For which cauſe, he neither foreſlowed to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the pietie of his daughter, nor thought good for him to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceale this wonder. And <hi>Alexandra</hi> her ſelfe, when ſhe came to riper yeares, tould it often to godlie men, who afterward related it to others, &amp; to me my ſelfe.

A Dalmatian Prieſt, a man of true ſimplicitie, and of great deuotion to the B.

Then in great rage, they aſſaulted the Prieſt with a drawne ſword, who calling on the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of <hi>Loreto,</hi> made a vow vnto her, that with the firſt oportunitie, he would go to <hi>Loreto,</hi> to viſit her, if life would giue him leaue. Which ſpeach did more enkindle the inraged Turkes: for compaſſing him about, and cutting and opening his breaſt, they drew out his bowells, tearing them from the vppermoſt partes, and deliuered them to him ſelfe now halfe dead, and by &amp; by, as they ſuppoſed, ready to fall downe, ſcorning him in this manner. Go, make haſte, &amp; carrie thy bowells in which thou ſaiſt <hi>Marie</hi> of <hi>Loreto</hi> doth adhere, vnto her, as thou haſt vowed. And albeit it exceed all credit, which we are now to deliuer: yet neither the power nor the goodnes of Almightie God. For the Prieſt who was readie to die (God prolonging death and giuing him ſufficient ſtrength) began to ſet forward, and ſpeedilie diſpatching a iourney of many dayes, came to <hi>Loreto,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19095:115"/>his bowells in his hand. Which way ſoeuer he went, great reſort was made vnto him, with deſire to ſee and to know the matter. Wherupon the Preiſt (but cheifly to the miniſters of the Church of <hi>Loreto</hi>) ſhewing his open and emptie breaſt, &amp; his bowells, which he held vp with his hand, declared breifly the whole matter, leauing them all amazed, with the admiration of ſo great a thing. And when he had giuen har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thankes to the B. Virgin, &amp; armed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the comfortable ſuccours of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The Duke followed the Armie, which he could not rule, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the ſacriledge that he could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But the protection of the B.

For the ſcoutes who were ſent before, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching neere to <hi>Loreto,</hi> and vaunting for ioy to ſee that all was cleere, ſuddainly a multitude of fierce wolues (that ſauage beaſtes might repreſſe the ſauageneſſe of men) ruſhed forth of the next wood, and as it were in battell order gaue an aſſault on the forerunners; deuoured and tore in peeces moſt of them, frighted out of their witts with the ſuddaine terrour; &amp; made the reſt to flie, more deſirous to ſaue them ſelues, then to ſeeke after the prey which they went about.

But the furious guiders of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, ſcoffing with ſoldier-like termes at the terrour of the ſcoutes, as vaine, made haſte to lay handes on their intended prey. But in very deed aſſoone as the ſacred Houſe ſhewed it ſelfe, ſuddainely great feare, came on all the armie, and like diſtracted people all began to tremble, with the dread that God ſtroke into their harts. Wherby their furie was ſo appeaſed, that the authours of the wickednes remembred them ſelues. and either the wrath of God, or els the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Church ſo affrighted them, that at one inſtant they deſiſted from their premeditated theft. But leſt they might returne againe to execute their intended

For when much of the day (as it is ſaid) was ſpent, a cloud fell ſuddainly from heauen, which by little and little thickening about the Church, tooke away the ſight therof, when notwithſtanding all the places ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, were bright with the ſunne-ſhine: which once being caſt before the ſouldiers eyes, made their mindes immooucable, and filled them with ſo great dread that they fell downe on their knees, and turning pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption into pietie, intended to go to <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto</hi> to pacifie the wrath of God, and his B. mother.

The porch of the Biſhops Pallace was vaulted: the well which (as we ſaid before <hi>Cardinall Roboreo</hi> cauſed to be made in the Cloiſter) was couered with a rooſe to the great good both of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants and of ſtrangers. But aboue all things <hi>Clement</hi> was moſt ſolicitous and carefull to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19095:123"/>finiſh the notable ornament of the moſt maieſticall chappell, with like magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as <hi>Leo</hi> had begunne it. Wherunto he was incenſed either with the pietie, or els with the honour of his houſe, that the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, which had the reputation for vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the carued worke of the Houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> might alſo haue it for finiſhing he ſame. Therfore with great expences he hired <hi>Antonie Sangall, Raphaell Baccio, Nicolas Tribulo,</hi> and other moſt famous Statuaries of that time, and commanded that <hi>Raynerio Neruſio</hi> of <hi>Piſa</hi> ſhould be ouerſeer of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Loreto,</hi> but ſpecially of that worthy worke, that it might be curiouſly finiſhed, according to the dignitie therof. When the rich marble was for the moſt part carued and poliſhed, and the reſt in hand, <hi>Neruſio</hi> beate downe the bricke walls, which were built for a prop to the ſacred Cell, and by miracle put of and remoued from the ſame (as we ſaid before) and layd them aſide for the people to beholde. Then leauing like ſpace betweene, to be monument of the olde miracle, they thought it beſt to inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron the ſacred Houſe with new walles and to couer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the carued marble, that they might not onely adorne the ſacred Chappell on the outſide, but alſo ſupport
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19095:124"/>the new vaute to be built therupon, when the olde vaute and rooſe was remooued and taken downe. It pleaſed the Pope, that the ſacred Houſe ſhould be vauted with ſtone, fearing if that the olde arched roofe, ſubiect to many lightes continually bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhould once be fired, it might bring vtter deſtruction to the moſt ſacred Cell. Therfore art required, that deeper foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and more firme ground-workes ſhould be laid to make that worthie and precious worke ſecure on euery ſide from earthquakes. Wherfore leſt the ſacred houſe ſhould receiue any alteration or detriment, by taking the earth from vnderneath, in opening the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the new walls, it was bound about with Carpets &amp; ropes, as the vſe is, and lifted vp with ſtrong ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that it might hang in the aire by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, vntill the trenches were filled vp, and the new foundations raiſed.

Therfore in ſo great a multitude &amp; concourſe of ſtrangers, one preſſing an other, diuers were ſtifled by thronging and preſſing of people, becauſe the laſt gaue no place vnto the firſt, as many times it happeneth.

But aſſoone as the aduiſe of the Architect was noiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,<note place="margin">Trad. Laur. Annal. Laur.

Wherupon manie open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounced and ſaid, that whoſoeuer would aduenture it, would not trulie eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape vnpuniſhed; therefore the feare of Gods wrath deterred the maſons from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking the worke; and the euent ſhewed that it was no vaine imagination. For to <hi>Neruſio</hi> the Architect himſelfe (going about the ſame) there hapned a thing wonderfull to be ſpoken and ſeene. For when the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons refuſed to do it, he himſelfe went to digge through the ſacred wall, with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er confidence in his art, then reuerence to the place. But aſſoone as he had forced his hammer againſt the ſacred wall, ſuddenly his hand became nummed, an vnwonted trembling inuaded the reſt of his body, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his countenance waxed pale, as a meſſenger
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:19095:125"/>of great euill, and ſhortly his hart fainting, they that were preſent, ſupported him fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe, and carried him home in their armes, like to one giuing vp the ghoſt, and void of all ſenſe. He lay almoſt 8. houres without life, vntill his wife a godly woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and much deuoted to our B. Lady of <hi>Loreto,</hi> with prayers and vowes had pacified the wrath of allmighty God and his B. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in behalfe of her husband: wherby the vitall heate hauing almoſt forſaken all the body, was at laſt reſtored to the ioynts, &amp; breath began to paſſe more freely: ſo that <hi>Neruſio</hi> lifting vp his eyes, and life returning vnto him by degrees, knew the ſtanders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and comming to himſelfe accuſed his owne raſhnes and aſked help and pardon of our B.

For his ſinne being forgiuen him and taken away by deuotion, did alſo take away the ſicknes of the body, that the care might demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrate the cauſe of the diſeaſe. Aſſoone as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, he aduertiſed the Pope of the whole matter, and asked his aduiſe what was beſt to be done: who being well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the ſaid euill happened vnto him more through to much confidence in him ſelfe, then the indignation of the B. Virgin (tempering his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand with godly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions)
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:19095:126"/>perſuaded <hi>Neruſio,</hi> that vnder the authority of the <hi>Vicar</hi> of God, and without any feare at all, he ſhould go forward with the worke which he had begunne, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly admoniſhed him, to digge through the ſacred walls, not ſo much with his hammer and boldnes, as armed with faſting and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration towards the B. Virgin, ſo at laſt the thing would ſucceed according to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. For it is not to be feared, that the B. Virgin Mother of God, will not haue her Houſe to become a through-fare, who will haue it open to Pilgrims, not only without their danger, but alſo for their good. But the Popes authority it ſelf could not inforce <hi>Neruſio,</hi> much frighted allready with the late euill of his preſumption, to experience that againe, which he aſſayed a little before, with ſo great danger to him ſelfe. At laſt becauſe the Popes command did vrge, and the delay of opening theſe doores hindred the building of the worke; there was a yong man, who ſeemed nothing fearfull to do it, who relying on the Popes authoritie, and much intreated by his friendes, would aduenture the thing. He was one of the Cleargie of the Church of <hi>Loreto,</hi> and was called <hi>Ventura Perino;</hi> who arming him ſelfe with three dayes faſt, came with his ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:19095:126"/>very reuerently to the ſacred wall. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout whome there flocked a multitude of ſtrangers and of the Cleargie, theſe ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of the yong mans confidence, thoſe in ſuſpence with the expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the thing. But with humble ſupplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Perino</hi> is ſaid to haue ſpoken thus. <hi>Sacred Houſe of the B. Virgin, pardon Innocencie, for I do not digge thee through with this hammer, but</hi> Clement <hi>the Vicar of God, deſirous of thy ornament: he coueteth to haue thee adorned, he, to haue thee a through-fare: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let it pleaſe the Mother of God, which pleaſeth the Vicar of God.</hi> Hauing prayed thus, he digged through the deſigned place of the wall without any puniſhment at all. And afterward the Maſons (prepared with like faſting and reuerence) followed him, itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his blowes with ſafetie, and opened three dores, wherof two giue free entrance and regreſſe to the people, and the third maketh way for the Prieſtes to the holier part of the ſacred Chappell, where the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the B.

At the ſame time the little win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, being alone in the fore wall, right almoſt againſt the Image, was made wider to receiue the light, and ſtrenghned with brazen barres, beautifully guilt.

The cauſe wherof was this: Becauſe about that time, as before hath bene ſaid, out of the Chronicles of <hi>Flumen,</hi> certaine <hi>Dalmatians</hi> brought to the Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Recanati,</hi> the relation of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of the ſacred Houſe, from <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene.</hi> Therfore either by reading the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of <hi>Angelita,</hi> or at the requeſt of his friends
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:19095:130"/>or rather being mooued by heauenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, <hi>Clement</hi> had a vehement deſire, to ſeeke out the remoouall of the ſacred Houſe in <hi>Galiley</hi> it ſelfe. And albeit he was not ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that, that very thing was made euident inough, both by the Dalmatians (<hi>Frangipane</hi> being the authour therof) as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the common conſent of <hi>Picene,</hi> at the ſuite of the Cittize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of <hi>Recanati;</hi> yet he held it to be the ſpeciall office of the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, laſt of all by ſpeciall men to ſeeke out the certaintie of ſo vnuſuall and almoſt ſo incredible a thing, that the authoritie of the Pontificall Sea, might confirme other folkes endeuours, vtterly to take away all doubt out of the hartes of men, if percha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce any ſhould remaine. Wherupon out of the number of his familie, he choſe three of his Chamber of approued religion and credit, whome he commanded to ſet forward, as ſoone as he had giuen them notice what they muſt do, and aboundantly furniſhed them with all things neceſſarie for them, wiſhing them a happie iourney. Who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Loreto,</hi> and viewing and meaſuring the ſacred Houſe with diligent care, ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped them ſelues for <hi>Sclauonie.</hi> Aſſoone as they came thither, they found a little an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient houſe like to that of <hi>Loreto,</hi> famous
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:19095:131"/>with the monumentes of miracles; on a wall wherof was written, that in times paſt the Houſe of <hi>Loreto</hi> had beene ſeated there.

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in vaine: for in great dangers in time of the battaile, the ſoldierlike man allwaies experienced and felt the fauourable help of the B. Virgin Mother of God.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:19095:133"/>certainty of the remoouall of the Houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> from <hi>Galiley</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> began ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to ſolicite <hi>Neruſio,</hi> to finiſh the moſt worthy ornament of the ſacred Cell with all ſpeed. But it ſeemed otherwiſe to God, who giuing <hi>Clement</hi> the reputation for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to effect ſo notable a worke, reſerued the honour for finiſhing &amp; ending it to an other. In ſetting vp ſo famous an orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and in bringing it to perfection (as much as lay in him) not onely his diligence, but alſo his magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was ſo remarkable, that not vnworthily fame doth report him the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it.

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:19095:134"/>Betwixt <hi>Recanati</hi> and the Adriaticke ſea, not far from the Riuer <hi>Muſion,</hi> on a little hill is ſeated the Church of B.

And being to ſpeake of ſo great a Church, whence I ſhall beginne I know not: For on the one part the exceeding religion of the place, and on the other the great we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alth of the Church doth preſent it ſelf vnto my minde; ſo that in verie deede my forces do faile me, endeuouring to ſpeake of that moſt holie and moſt religious cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Whiles theſe offices of Chriſtian Charitie were feruent, the workes of <hi>Loreto</hi> which <hi>Clement</hi> had begunne, were not altogeather omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

The ancient opinion is, that thoſe earthen Veſſells were found long agone by the Apoſtles, in the Armorie of the <hi>B.

No light coniectures do confirme this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which ſeeme, to make it credible to many, that thoſe earthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Veſſells were of the houſhold ſtuffe of the Mother of God. For
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:19095:144"/>(as we may coniecture by them which at this day are extant) they do not much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the meane ſorte, and ſuch as are commonlie vſed: and in bignes there is greate inequalitie among them, whereas indeed the ornature of the Sacred Houſe, and the compaſſe of the ſemicircles, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to be of like equalitie; that we may vnderſtand, they were not ſo much prouided for the ornature of the ſacred Chappell, as the ornament it ſelf accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to them. But whether they were of our B. Ladies houſholde ſtuffe, or els were prouided of purpoſe for the ornature of her ſacred Cell onelie, being dedicated togeather with her fortunate Houſe, with great reaſon they were euer religiouſlie eſteemed. Yet now I find manie of them to haue periſhed, pilfered away (as I imagin) to propagate the Religion of the B. Virgin of <hi>Loreto.</hi> Wherupon diuers of them which were left, were placed in the wall of the Church of <hi>Loreto,</hi> by the doore which is in the ſide, where at this day they remanie to be ſeene. Few of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are reſerued without ſome miracle or other. For I am ſure that a Prieſt of <hi>Loreto</hi> of my acquaintance, being much troubled with the head-ach, was preſently cured by applying a ſacred potte
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:19095:145"/>vnto his head. And an other Prieſt tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a grieuous feuer, and drinking colde water in the ſame, by and by had his ſicknes taken away. But the reliques of the ſacred boardes, carried the religion of the Houſe of <hi>Loreto</hi> almoſt throughout the whole world. For being diſperſed abroad and diſtributed from one to another, they came almoſt into all Countreys, who eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them for ſacred reliques, as reaſon required, they exceedinglie increaſed the reuerence of the B. Virgin of <hi>Loreto,</hi> with whoſe religion (as it may well be ſuppoſed) they were, after a certaine ſort, indued. And it is verie likelie that by this occaſion Oratories were erected in honour of the B. Virgin of <hi>Loreto,</hi> in diuers parts of the world, either as monuments to their people of her ſingular protection, or els as ſolaces to them, whome ſicknes, buſines, or other impediments hindred from going to <hi>Loreto.</hi> For it is well knowne (but at this time ſpeciallie) not in <hi>Picene</hi> and <hi>Italie</hi> onelie; but alſo beyond the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and in far remote Countreys, many Chappells were erected to the B.

A very white and a beautifull doue, flying peaceably vp and downe ouer his head, in the preſence of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:19095:167"/>many people, ſometimes reſted on the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the Sacrificant, ſometimes on the Miſſal it ſelf; which filled them that were preſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with great admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der. The Prieſt, who (as the vſe is) aſſiſted the Card. in tyme of the dreadfull Sacrifice, thinking it to be ſome ordinary doue come thither by cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, aſſaied to driue her away. But the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall well remembring that here to ſore in former ages, ſometimes Biſhops had beene deſigned from aboue, by the manifeſtation and ſhewing of a white doue, forbad him to diſquiet her. Whereuppon he permitted the heauenly doue to reſt, till the Sacrifice being ended, ſhe flew away of her owne accorde. Shortly after, a heauenly viſion confirmed the truth hereof vnto him. For <hi>Marcellus</hi> being called to <hi>Rome</hi> by a meſſenger of the Popes death, would not commit himſelf to his iourney, and to the election of the new Pope, vntill he had ſaluted the B. Virgin of <hi>Loreto,</hi> according to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. And the ſacred day of the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins <hi>Annunciation</hi> being at hand, did more inuite his godly minde. Therfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to <hi>Loreto</hi> the day before, and ſhutting out the rude people on the Feſtiuall day, he began to ſay maſſe with great attention in the moſt Maieſticall Cell of the B. Virgin.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:19095:168"/>And in time of the dreadfull Sacrifice, a litle after the beginning of the Canon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the Church depriued of her Paſtour, and recommending her moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to God and the B.

So admirable &amp; ſo ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge a thing happening to <hi>Marcellus</hi> on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, ſtroke him into ſuch a feare, that trembling at the Altar, he could ſcarce ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on his feete. Whereuppon the Prieſt who aſſiſted him in time of the dreadfull Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, perceiued that ſomething was reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Cardinall from aboue: ſpecially becauſe his face ſeemed to ſhine with a certaine vnwonted brightnes, and alſo, all his body to be inuironed with a new light: which with great familiarity he reported to many others, &amp; alſo to <hi>Raphael Riera,</hi> who ſet it downe in writing. Yea and the <hi>Card.</hi> himſelf being importuned with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of his friends, who were preſent at that heauenly viſion, tolde the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it happened; adding withall that ſo
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:19095:168"/>great an office, as that of the high Biſhop, was far beyond his deſert; and therefore peraduenture Almighty God would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide an other Vicar for himſelf. But if it were the will of God, to haue ſuch a Vicar on earth, truly the firſt thing that he would do, ſhould be to preſerue the Chriſtian Common-Wealth in good ſtate, &amp; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the reuerence of the Houſe of <hi>Loreto</hi> far and neere. Whereuppon returning to <hi>Monte-Fano,</hi> and ſending for the notarie, he comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to be ſet downe in publicke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, what he was determined to do, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our B.

And to build this Cittie, he inuented this eaſie and expedite way, that is to ſay, to inuite the pooreſt families of all the Popes domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to inhabite the new Towne, partly with hope of reward, partly alſo with the deuotion of our B. Lady of <hi>Loreto:</hi> to diuide in common to the new Inhabitants, the next wood purchaſed with the Common treaſure, that they might cut downe the trees, &amp; deſtroy the copſes, for their greater commodity and better tilling of their land: So in ſhort time the new Citty would be well prouided of fruite, wine and oile inough: neither would Merchants (allured with hope of gaine) faile to be there: by reaſon that great reſort would be vnto the place; whereby in time exceeding honour and reuerence would be donne to the B. Virgin of <hi>Loreto.</hi> But it ſeemed otherwiſe to God, <hi>whoſe iudgements are inſcrutable:</hi> for it was his holy will, that he ſhould rather ſet down, in writing, his worthy purpoſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> than performe
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:19095:169"/>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indeed.

But this was his chiefeſt care, grounded on the determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> to inlarge the Colledge of the Society of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> For although thoſe Fathers, which were then at <hi>Loreto,</hi> beſtowed greater labour on the Pilgrimes, then was conuenient for ſo ſmall a number: yet ſo few were not able to deale with ſuch a multitude of ſtrangers, as dayly increaſed, ſpecially when out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Contreys, many of different language reſorted more and more vnto it, whereof diuers could not be confeſſed, for want of Prieſts to vnderſtand them. The Fathers of the Society, were as ſorrowfull as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they ſhould returne home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, fruſtrated of their hope and vow, which prouoked the Cardinall of <hi>Carpa,</hi> to thinke how he might increaſe the number of thoſe Fathers. For being very glad that the Colledge which he had procured to be planted in the ſoile of <hi>Loreto</hi> (albeit yet ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:19095:170"/>and new) partly brought forth, and partly made ſhew of much ſpirituall fruite; he healt earneſtly with the Pope to inlarge it, ſuppoſing that, that would happen, which came to paſſe, to witt, that it would bring forth a moſt fruitfull and plentifull harueſt, when the fruites themſelues were fullie increaſed &amp; ripe. Wherefore the 55 yeare of this age, by the Popes approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and allowance, he effected, that thirty lacking two, ſhould be added to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer number, that fortie of the Society of IESVS might be mayntained at <hi>Loreto.</hi> And the Society deceiued not the hope of the Cardinall nor of the Pope. For their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge being thus increaſed with Prieſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in forraine tongues, was a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to the deuotion of Pilgrims, and no ſmall benefit to the Houſe of <hi>Loreto</hi> it ſelf. Becauſe from that time, the Pilgrims of moſt Nations, fynding Prieſts of their owne Contrey, with whome they might freely deale without an interpreter, by their helpe returned home againe, not only purged of their ſinnes, but alſo inſtructed with Chriſtian inſtitutions and precepts.

But by the manifeſt wrath of God,

But Almightie God ſpeedily cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed their hainous ſacriledge, with deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued puniſhment. For aſſoone as they had hid all that they had ſtolne, in a ſhip which was in the harbour, they made haſt to ſteale away. But as they ſailed along the ſhore of <hi>Picene,</hi> foule weather brought them back to the place, where they ſhipped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:19095:187"/>wherby falling into the hands of the Officers of <hi>Recanati,</hi> they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in their manifeſt theft: and for examples ſake (leſt others ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture the like) were preſently hanged before the Houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> paying for their wicked ſacriledge, with that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death. But others hoping to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape ſhortly after, were prouoked and tempted to aſſay the like miſchiefe. For a certaine forlorne wretch hauing a great deſire to rob the moſt ſacred Chappell, and getting a fit companion for his ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious attempt, prepared engines to open the lockes of the dores, and of the cheſt where the money is kept: and when he had prouided all things for that purpoſe, craftily hid himſelf in the ſacred Cell of the B. Virgin. Whereuppon going about to execute his ſacrilegious deſire in the dead of the night, he gathered the ſacred Donaries of gold and ſiluer into one place; And when he had opened the Arcke and the doores of the ſacred Chappell, he alſo aſſayed to burſt open the leaues of the Church-doore it ſelf: which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as he had broken open, he began to looke about to ſeeke the complice of his wickednes; who at that very houre (for
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:19095:188"/>ſo they had agreed) was to be in readines in the Church porch, to hide the ſacred gifts, and the money in an appointed place. But beholde whiles he intentiuely looked about, he ſaw a companie of armed people at hand (a multitude of heauenly ſpirits, as it was ſuppoſed) watching the Houſe of the B.

But the vnhappy man hauing eſcaped that danger (as he thought) and auarice egging him on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to aduenture the thing againe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uppon opening the dores of the Church againe, and the third time, to ſeeke out the complice of his miſchiefe, allwaies that heauenly company met him in armes, and with all ſpeed forced him to fly againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church. Hauing thus ſpent the night betweene hope and feare, at laſt he was more ſollicitous of his life, then of the prey, and determined to depart without his purpoſe. For the morning being ready to approach, he aſſayed to get away by a back doore of the Church; but ſtill being frighted with the encounter of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly watch, which we haue mentioned, he fled back againe into the moſt ſacred
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:19095:188"/>Cell, where remained manifeſt ſignes of his attempted ſacriledge, that, the place which was the witnes of his wickednes, might alſo manifeſtlie declare the ſame.

Speaking theſe wordes with great repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of minde, the wound was preſentlie cured, and he recouered perfect health of bodie. But health reſtored to an vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diſſolute man, was almoſt his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: who quite forgetting ſo great a benefit, thought it not inough to neglect his vow, vnles he alſo abuſed the benefit of his recouerie, with the licenciouſnes of his former life.

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:19095:198"/>for the preſent domage, then for future example. Whereupon euerie one pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that there would be an end of the moſt ſacred Cell of the B.

Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding becauſe the Popes authoritie did vrge, after diuine ſeruice and a ſolemne proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Chanons and the Prieſts of <hi>Loreto</hi> aſſembled themſelues into the ſacred Cell of the B.

For all reſolutelie refuſing ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, with a fit inſtrument, <hi>Stella</hi> himſelf pulled and tooke the ſtone out of the wall, all the keepers of the ſacred Houſe ſaying confidently vnto him, that it would be but ſhort ioy vnto his Biſhop, that the Miniſter of ſacriledge might take that from God and his B. Mother, which doubtleſſe by the manifeſt indignation of them both, he would ſhortlie bring back againe. It was a Propheſie. For theſe wordes ſeeming to come from heauen, pierced the breſt of the audacious man, and filled it with anxious cares. Whereuppon vncertaine what to do (albeit the command of his Biſhop did vrge) he ſtaied eight whole
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:19095:198"/>daies at <hi>Loreto,</hi> and ſpent all that time in vaine to pacific Almightie God. For how could he aſſwage the heauenly wrath, who ſuffered the cauſe therof to remaine about him? At laſt on the Calendes of December he began his iourney, much troubled in minde with a certaine religious dread &amp; ſollicitude. And coming to <hi>Anconae</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any inconuenience, and holding on his iourney without feare of ill ſucceſſe, he preſentlie perceiued that Almightie God did puniſh him for his raſhneſſe. Becauſe from that time he was alwaies ſo mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with raine and tempeſtuous weather (yet perſeuering ſtill to go whither he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) that euerie moment he eſcaped many and great dangers of life. For moſt of the waies were almoſt vnpaſſable by reaſon of lakes and ſtreames which hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him. Alſo furious waters encounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, threatened him deſtruction. Likewiſe the horſe on which he rode being not able to ſtand, fell downe; and he himſelf tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling after, was ſo moiled in the lakes, that he was enforced to change his horſes, but he had no better ſucceſſe with any. And thus diuers accidents hindering his vnluckie iourney, he came at length to <hi>Trent,</hi> in the end of the moneth of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:19095:199"/>(hauing paſſed many inconueniences and dangers) and deliuered the ſacred ſtone vnto the Biſhop, telling him how deerlie he had bought it. But the Biſhop being made nothing more circumſpect therby (hauing ſpace ſtrangelie giuen him to repent) nor willing to learne by an others perill, was taught by his owne. For about the end of <hi>Februarie,</hi> inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſacred ſtone in a ſiluer caſe and preparing to ſend it into <hi>Portugall,</hi> he was ſuddainlie taken with an extreme burning feuer, and began to be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie anguiſhed and moleſted therwith; which brought with it a more grieuous and cruell diſeaſe, to witt moſt bitter paine of the groine, which permitted him to take no reſt at all. Forthwith Phiſitians are ſet aworke, who applying all things in vaine (becauſe his ſicknes comming to him as a puniſhment from God, the cure therof might verie well ſurpaſſe their skill) they conſtantlie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that the force and cauſe of his griefe, ſeemed not to them any humane thing. Therefore it was beſt for him to conſider, whether peraduenture Almighty God might not inflict that horrible pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment vpon him, for offending him:
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:19095:199"/>And ſo fearing vnfortunate euent of the cure, they departed, deſpairing of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie. Wheruppon the Biſhop was verie ſollicitous and much perplexed in himſelf, whether for any ſecret offence, Alm. God had inflicted ſuch horrible pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment on him. And being thus forſaken of the Phyſitians, he began to be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more in minde then in bodie, to looke diligentlie into himſelf. And becauſe he was troubled with a ſcruple about the ſtone which he procured from <hi>Loreto,</hi> he ceaſed not to mitigate the wrath of God by all the meanes he could, and with ſighes and feruent praier, to aske pardon of the B. Virgin of <hi>Loreto,</hi> if perchance he had offended, by violating her ſacred Houſe, and to confeſſe that he was ready to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deſcend to all to make ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. His praier was not vnheard, aſſoone as in ſome ſort he acknowledged and deteſted his fault. For within a while, he ſeemed to heare a ſilent voice (as it were from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen) commanding him to reſtore the ſtone which he had taken from the B. Virgin of <hi>Loreto.</hi> But fearing leſte it might be the vaine immagination of a weake minde, both becauſe he had gotten it by the Popes authoritie, and alſo for that he
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:19095:200"/>would not defraud Portugall of ſo great a good, now obtained for her; he remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned doubtfull what to do. In this meane while ſome weekes were ſpent. Wherup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon by commandement of his Lord, at laſt <hi>Stella</hi> carefully recommended the Biſhop verie dangerouſly ſicke, to two holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries of ſacred Virgins in the Cittie of <hi>Trent.</hi> And within two dayes, one of the chiefe of either Monaſterie brought an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, if that the Biſhop would be cured, he muſt reſtore that which he had taken from the B. Virgin of <hi>Loreto.</hi> when <hi>Stella</hi> heard what they ſaid, he was amazed, admiring how Virgins ſhutt vp in their Cloiſters, could know of the ſtone of <hi>Loreto,</hi> which truly at <hi>Trent</hi> beſides himſelf &amp; the Biſhop none knew, becauſe he commanded the thing to be concealed with all care, Not doubting therefore, but that the whole matter was ſhewed vnto them by a heauenlie ſigne, he tolde his Lord what he had heard. Whereat the Biſhop remained like one aſtoniſhed; and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with remorſe, gaue many ſighes. And by and by with his elbow lifting himſelf vp vpon the bed where he lay, and holding vp both hands &amp; eyes to heauen, with trickling teares, he erneſtly intreated
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:19095:200"/>pardon of the Mother of God. That the mercifull Mother would vouchſafe to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his pious errour: that ſhe would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue him, acknowledging his fault. For he would keepe nothing of the Houſe of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto,</hi> againſt her will; he was reſolued &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined forthwith to reſtore that, which he had receiued thence, and miſtruſted not but to recouer health by her meanes, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as he had reſtored the ſacred ſtone vnto her; that ſhe would therfore help him, who had giuen him this hope. He failed not in his promiſe, nor the B. Virgin his hope. For preſently <hi>Suarez</hi> commanded <hi>Stella</hi> himſelf (who brought it) to recarry it backe to <hi>Loreto,</hi> with all the ſpeed he could. Neither in vaine. For he was ſcarce gone out of the gate of the Citty on a horſe of good ſpeed, but the Biſhop began to feele himſelf better, and out of hand ſent after him, another Poſt, to charge <hi>Stella</hi> to make as much haſt as might be. Wheruppon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king freſh horſes, and little regarding his owne reſt, he poſted ſpeedily day &amp; night, making haſt to come to <hi>Loreto.</hi> A wonder to be ſpoken.

This ſeemed not to be without miracle, that <hi>Stella</hi> in taking away the ſacred ſtone, had no harder and troubleſome a iourney, than facile and expedite, when he brought it backe againe. For it is euident, that he poſted from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Ancona</hi> (which is but xv. miles from <hi>Loreto</hi>) within foure daies; ſo much did not the ſpeed of horſes, as a certaine prouidence of Almighty God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his returne.

Such another confirmed the certaintie of this miracle. <hi>Bernardine San-Seuerino</hi> Prince of <hi>Biſinia</hi> (the Father of him that now is) liuing many yeares with his wife, had no children by her. And being long fruſtrated by the hope of Phyſitians and phyſicke, he was grieued not onelie for want, but alſo becauſe he had no hope of iſſue, whome he might leaue heyre of ſo great a Signio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

When he awaked, a certaine tongue (as it may ſeeme) began to grow againe, by which he vttered the conceite of his mind, without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty at all. And the Viceroy returning from <hi>Loreto,</hi> and vnderſtanding of the matter, thought good to pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, whom the B. Virgin herſelf had pardoned.

When he came thither, not only the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royes letter, but alſo the thing it ſelf wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the miracle to all. For when he opened his mouth (a wonderfull thing to be ſeene) they ſaw that his tongue was cut out, and that a certaine little tongue did grow vnderneath in place of the other, wherewith when he himſelf would (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit with ſtammering) they heard him

The people of <hi>Viterbo</hi> ornature for the Altar made of gold &amp; ſiluer. With theſe alſo came other Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from worthy, but from vnknowne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe memory hath periſhed I know not by what miſchance. There is a Statua almoſt a Cubit long of ſolid gold, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a naked Child, wrought with meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous art, the giuer whereof and the cauſe is not expreſſed.

                  <hi>Dominicke a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro-Florentino</hi> a Contrey-man, dwelt in a cottage not far from the Riuer <hi>Elſa,</hi> with two companions of his. Which on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine night breaking ouer the bankes with great aboundance of rayne, began to ouer-flow the next fieldes far and wide; and flowing thence with great violence, carried away floting with it, whatſoeuer it met. Wheruppon <hi>Dominicke</hi> awaking out of his ſleepe with the noyſe of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſtreame, and putting his head out of his cottage, beheld the fields round about, ouerflowne with water, and the floud ready to come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. So fearing leſt the preſent deluge would make an end of him, forthwith he and his fellowes climbed vp to the toppe of the Cottage, and there remained, the danger ſtill increaſing, often
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:19095:221"/>calling on the B. Virgin of <hi>Loreto.</hi> The cottage was built of wattles and ſtraw, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And the implored help of our B. Lady did not faile them. For the cottage running to and fro, with force of the wandering ſtreame, for the ſpace of two mile, came at laſt to a great tree, which they eſteeming a heauenly benefit, let go the cottage, clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed into the tree with ſpeed, and ſtayed there vntill the violence of the water ceaſing, and the floud it ſelf decreaſing, returned into the channell againe: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were all ſaued, not ſo much by help of the tree, as by the B. Virgin, next after God. Furthermore by double benefit of the B. Virgin of <hi>Loreto,</hi> others were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from imminent danger of Pirats, and from a great tempeſt. A ſhip of <hi>Ancona</hi> loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with merchandize of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> being eſpied by many Pyraticall Pinnaces, as ſhe returned to <hi>Italie,</hi> was preſently beſet round about, and cruellie aſſaulted with Ordinance and weapons.

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:19095:222"/>aſſault of the Barbarians in hope of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly alde. Meane while by mutuall exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, all at once called on the B. Virgin of <hi>Loreto,</hi> and made their praier more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall with a vow. A maruailous thing to be ſpoken. Forthwith ſuch courage and ſtrength was giuen to al their companie, that renewing the fight, they notablie reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the force of their enemies, and by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the B. Virgin were deliuered out of preſent danger. But hauing eſcaped this danger of the Pirats, &amp; ſayling along with a proſperous winde, without any feare at all, ſuddainly by change of weather, they were brought into greater danger by the ſea it ſelf. For not far from the towne <hi>Aulon,</hi> ſituated by the <hi>Acroceraunion</hi> Rocks (which, by corruption, the Inhabitants call <hi>Velona</hi>) a foule tempeſt threatned them preſent deſtruction, and made them all ſo fearefull, that they made a vow to our B.

Wherby the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peſt was preſently aſſwaged, and the ſhippe returning to her courſe came to <hi>Ancona</hi> without any harme at all; the ſpeed wherof was ſuch, that within the ſpace of ſix houres, ſhe ſailed from <hi>Aulon</hi> to <hi>Ancona.</hi> Wherfore all the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:19095:223"/>barks, made haſt to purſue their ſlaues flying away; and there wanted not much, that <hi>Michaell</hi> and his fellowes had not beene taken and brought backe againe by the Barbarians, to be puniſhed with great torture and paine.

And the thing it ſelf well ſhewed that it was ſent on the enemies by miracle.

The yeare after Chriſts Natiuity 1570. a certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Noble both by bloud and deedes (Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors deliuer not his name, I thinke that himſelf would haue it ſuppreſſed) was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in irons, by one of the chiefeſt Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of <hi>Italy,</hi> and charged with falſe crimes before a wicked and a wrathfull Iudge.

For when the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile at ſea was begunne, a thing not ſo much of humane, as of heauenly vertue &amp; fauour was ſeene. For the winde turning for the Chriſtians (which before the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile was againſt them) and beating the ſmoake of the ordinance, and the muskets
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:19095:228"/>of the enemies on their owne heads, a moſt famous victorie was gotten of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians: moſt of the enemies were ſlaine, their ſhipps ſunke or taken, a great prey, a multitude of Captiues, aboue ten thouſand Chriſtians were deliuered from their ſeruitude, wherof trulie the far greater part, came afterward to <hi>Loreto</hi> to performe their vowes. And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the very day of the fight, before the trumpets ſounded, the Chriſtian ſlaues whome the Turkes had condemned to the oar, made vowes to our B. Lady of <hi>Loreto</hi> for their liberty; and the like alſo did many Captaines and ſouldiours of the Chriſtian Nauy for life and victory, that none may doubt, but next after God, ſo worthy a victory was due to the Mother of God. Wherefore not onely the ſlaues of the Turkes which rowed, but alſo many ſouldiours and Chriſtian Captaines came to <hi>Loreto</hi> to giue due thankes to God and our B. Lady, and to performe their vowes. And both the one and the other would haue monuments of the heauenly benefit to remaine there.<note place="margin">Annal. Laur.

For well knowing that euen in many places of the Popes Dominions, the waies which went to <hi>Loreto</hi> were ſo difficult and ſtrait, that they ſcarce affoarded free paſſage to horſe or man, and thinking it would be glorious to B. <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Loreto,</hi> to haue them ſo broad &amp; ſo repaired, that it might eaſilie &amp; ſecurely be gone vnto with coaches; he opened and playned the chiefeſt wayes through

<pb n="406" facs="tcp:19095:231"/>it were, a wonder to them that met them. Their ſolemnity was this. Many went before in the habit of Penitents, carrying the figures of the torments and death of Chriſt our Lord, who attiring themſelues in ſackcloath, went in a long and a well diſpoſed companie, ſprinckling their heades with aſhes, barefooted, and beating their backs with continuall ſtripes.

For by name of a dowry, the Duke ſent with it a perpetuall ſtipend, that euery yeare vpon forty feſtiuall and ſolemne dayes, the ſame might burne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the B. Virgin, with foure and twenty white Candles of wax. Soone after the Duke himſelf followed his gifts, and foure onely accompanying him to <hi>Loreto,</hi> with freſh horſes he poſted thither vnknowne, the yeare 1585. The exceeding modeſty of ſo great a Prince, made his piety the more notable. For contemning humane deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies, that he might taſt the diuine more
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:19095:252"/>aboundantly, he eſteemed the publicke and magnificent lodgings aſſigned for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynment of Princes, leſſe then a priuate and meane hoſpitall. For inſteed of the trouble and ſtate of a Princely Court, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to giue himſelf to religious quietnes, he went very familiarily to the Fathers of the Society of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> of which order he hath deſerued great honour, and lodged with them certaine dayes, being very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with ordinary fare and intertayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But ſo great vertue could not long be kept ſecret. For the Gouernour of <hi>Loreto,</hi> vnderſtanding of the comming of the Duke of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> came preſently vnto him, and very curteouſly inuited, requeſted, vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, importuned to giue him intertaynme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; but at laſt ſeeing that he refuſed it with a moſt reſolute mind, he departed fruſtrated of his deſire. And the modeſty of the Duke was as notable in the Church as in his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. For a footſtoole to kneele vpon, and a chaire to ſit in, being prepared for him with Princely ſtate, he ſo contemned them, that he did not ſo much as looke at them, becauſe he came not to ſeeke ſumptuouſnes, but piety and deuotion in the Houſe of our B. Lady of <hi>Loreto.</hi> Further in the moſt maieſticall Cell of the B. Virgin, his chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:19095:253"/>humility and piety was ſo notable, that others may admire it. For he prayed among the multitude, with ſuch ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of mind and body, as that you would haue taken him for one of the people: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did often (as I belieue) recall to mind the humility of the Sonne of God, <hi>who when he was in the forme of God, there exina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited himſelf, taking the forme of a ſeruant.</hi> He was ſo long in praier, that he might ſeeme to dwell in the ſacred Houſe of the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and at his departure left behind him, as notable ſignes of his munificence, as of his piety and deuotion.<note place="margin">The vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy gift of the Duke of Bauaria.</note> His chiefeſt gift was a little booke of ſolid gold, which being diuided three manner of wayes, in foure leaues, ſeemeth to containe beautifull pictures and Images wrought in precious ſtone. The couer wherof is made of gold, orient pearle and rich iewells, with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable art, and hangeth by three chaines of gold, comming through a gold ring to be faſtened in a great Saphire. This gift is ſaid to be worth eight thouſand Crownes: and there is ſcarce an other to be found among all the donaries and Treaſure of the Houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> which ſtrangers behold with more delight, and deſire; ſo greatly doth the ornature, &amp; the exceeding beauty

Aboue twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares, a Cittizen of <hi>Palermo</hi> comming to <hi>Loreto,</hi> &amp; ſecretly taking a litle ſtone out of the ſacred Cell of the Mother of God, by no ſhew of piety in that raſh deed, nor the ignorance of the Pontificall inhibition, by any meanes could be deliuered from the wrath of God. For aſſoone as he returned home, forthwith he was troubled with a grieuous ſicknes. And leſt the cauſe of his ſuddaine griefe might be doubtfull, yearly
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:19095:257"/>about the ſame time, that he committed the fault, he ſuffered puniſhment for it. Wheruppon ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth ſuddainly fayling him, in the moneth of September or October, he was moleſted with a grieuous feuer, and by iudgment of the Phyſitians, there could be no naturall cauſe therof; and he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged not his fault, coloured vnder the name of piety. But it continued 20. yeares. all which time there was neither cauſe nor end of his incurable diſeaſe. And at laſt, when no other cauſe of the ſicknes (ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning by courſe) could be found, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion entred into his heauy mind, &amp; being much tormented with a guilty conſcience, he opened the wound vnto a Prieſt; who told him that the cauſe of his ſicknes, was his raſh piety, earneſtly exhorting him to reſtore the ſacred ſtone, if he would make ſure way for his health. It was ſpoken to no deafe eares. For the ſicke man being commanded as it were by a heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly voice, deliuered him the ſacred ſtone, to be ſent backe to the place from whence he had taken it long agoe. Aſſoone as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, he recouered his former health. The thing is well witneſſed. <hi>Iohn Baptiſta Carminata,</hi> Superiour of the Society of IESVS in the Prouince of <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſent the
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:19095:257"/>ſacred ſtone, with letters declaring the whole matter, to <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Cardinall Vaſtauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lano</hi> Patron of <hi>Loreto,</hi> who ſent it ſtraight to <hi>Leonorius</hi> Gouernour of <hi>Loreto,</hi> with the letter which he receiued out of <hi>Sicily,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that it ſhould be carefully put into the place where it was before. Wheruppon aſſoone as it came to <hi>Loreto, Leonorius</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a ſolemne proceſſion, and going to the gate to meet it, recarried it to the moſt ſacred Houſe, with the greateſt pompe that might be. A meruailous thing to be ſpoken and ſeene. It was ſcant brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fortunate Houſe of our B. Lady; when by and by (as if God had ſhewed it) the voide place appeared, whence it was euident, that fragment was taken twenty yeares agone; and aſſoone as it was put into his owne place againe, a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance was made in token of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to repreſſe the boldnes of other Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims. About the ſame time, the new raſhnes of mortall men, gaue God occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſhew new example, in the leſſer pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſtones. I finde many exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of many, who adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>turing the ſame, quickly ſmarted for their folly, vntill they had learned by their owne harme, to reſtore that which they had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence. But we will omit
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:19095:258"/>them, leſt many things of one kind ſhould breed tediouſnes. Neither did Almighty God ſeeme to be more carefull to preſerue the ſacred ſtones, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the morter, wherwith the ſtones themſelues are ioyned togeather. <hi>Alexandria</hi> is no meane Citty of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> built and ſo called by the Confederate Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in fauour of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third.

Virgin, and returning home bruized it, and put it into a ſiluer caſe, togeather with an AGNVS DEI. But his fooliſh piety was nothing pleaſing to God and his B. Mother. For aſſoone as he hung that caſe about his wiues necke (for what cauſe it is vncertaine) the Prince of Diuells entred into her, with no ſmall company of his attendants: wherwith the vnhappy woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being miſerably vexed for the ſpace of nine yeares, to her husbands great griefe, at laſt, God of his goodnes ſent her remedy. <hi>Iohn Baptiſta Vauninus</hi> a Prieſt of the Society of IESVS, preached at that time to the people of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as the manner is. Who vnderſtanding of the matter by her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (the author of ſo wicked a thing) forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with exhorted him to reſtore the ſacred
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:19095:258"/>duſt; if he did, no doubt, but in ſhort time his wife would be deliuered from diuells wherewith ſhe was tormented. He was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perſuaded. For taking the ſacred morter out of the ſiluer caſe, he himſelf deliuered it to <hi>Vauninus,</hi> beſeeching him to ſend it to <hi>Loreto</hi> with all ſpeed. Their hope deceiued them not. For within few daies, three of the tormenting diuells, were expelled out of the body of the poſſeſſed woman, not ſo much by vertue of the Exorciſmes, as by the praier of our B. Lady. Wheruppon <hi>Vauninus</hi> putting the ſaid morter into a caſe, ſent it preſently to <hi>Loreto,</hi> to the Rector of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of IESVS, intreating him by letter, with all ſpeed to reſtore it, to the ſacred Houſe of our B.

And aſſoone as the morter was brought backe to <hi>Loreto,</hi> it was reſerued in a conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place, to be a document to mortall men, not to aduenture the like.

For <hi>Edmund</hi> an Iriſh-Man, Biſhop of <hi>Ardach,</hi> came to <hi>Loreto,</hi> to performe his double vow. The cauſe wherof was this. Being driuen into baniſhment for religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queene of <hi>England,</hi> he fled into <hi>Scotland</hi> with certaine truſtie ſeruants. But where he ſought ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, was his danger. For at the intreaty of the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> commanded that he ſhould be caſt into priſon. But <hi>Edmund</hi> vnderſtanding of the matter, ſecretly ſhipped himſelf, and very prudently eſchewed the ſnares of the Queene. Wherby eſcaping that manifeſt peril, ſoone after he fell into an other hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den danger, which was not caſuall, but by ſufferance from aboue, as doubtles both the time of the danger, &amp; the heauenly help

For as <hi>Edmund</hi> ſailed towards <hi>France,</hi> he fell into the hands of one <hi>Drake</hi> an Archpirate of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> the day before the Natiuity of our B. Lady, which the Biſhop &amp; his ſeruants kept with great reuerence and deuotion. And a viſion ſhewed to one of his company in his ſleep, put them all in good hope of ſecurity. For the night before they met their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as he was aſleep, one of his ſeruants ſeemed to fight naked with heretickes in a great aſſembly of men: and being aſhamed of his nakednes, a Lady of great beauty came vnto him in a white garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whome he earneſtly intreating to couer his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, curteouſly and willingly ſhe coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him with her cloake. When he related this viſion vnto the Biſhop, with common co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent they agreed, that the Virgin whome he ſaw in his ſleepe, was the Mother of God, by whoſe protection they ſhould be all defended. Wheruppon aſſoone as the nauy of the enemies approached, <hi>Edmund</hi> and his ſeruants ſeeing no humane meanes to eſcape, implored our B. Lady of <hi>Loreto,</hi> whoſe Natiue day put them all in good hope of ſafety, making this vow with their petition: If they eſchewed the hands of their enemies, they would go to the
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:19095:269"/>Houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> and there for the ſpace of three daies, would giue themſelues to prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Their praier and vow had effect. For the Maiſter of the ſhippe, wherin they ſayled, albeit in ſhew an Hereticke; yet at that inſtant ſhewed himſelf a fauourer of Catholicks. For ſeeing the Engliſh nauy at hand, and ſuppoſing (as it was) that the Catholicks whome he tranſported, were ſought, for their deſtruction, he hid the Biſhop and his ſeruants, in a moſt obſcure place of the pumpe, and far out of ſight. The ſhip was taken by the Engliſh, and brought in to <hi>England,</hi> &amp; the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God lay cloſe eight daies in the pumpe, the Maiſter ſecretly conueying them victuals once a day; all which time the Engliſh Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats did not negligently ſearch the veſſell which they had taken. For euery day with great rage, they ſearched euery corner, hoping to finde out the Biſhop and his company, of whoſe flight and eſcape they had notice. So at laſt reuiewing all places carefully with lights, they happened on the pumpe, and came to the ſecret place. But the more preſent that their danger was, the more euident was the help of the Mother of God. For apprehending the Prieſt, who had ſeene the aforeſaid
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:19095:270"/>viſion in his ſleep, they drew him vnto the next decke to ſeeke out the reſt, but euen at that very inſtant they perceiued, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God did protect the Catholicks with heauenly help. For the Prieſt (of whome we ſpeake) eſcaping out of their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds by miracle, was neuer after to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Therefore hauing ſearched eight whole daies, till they were wearie, at laſt they gaue ouer to ſeeke after the Biſſhop, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed the ſhippe, that ſhe might returne vnto her courſe. But behold one danger after an other. In the ſame voiage to <hi>France,</hi> an other Nauy of Pirats met them, more cruell then the former, who by the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſought <hi>Edmund</hi> the Biſhop for his deſtruction: and out of hand taking the ſhippe wherin he ſailed, they boarded her, ouerturned all the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, and with lights ſearched all places with diligent care: wherby they came to the ſecret place, &amp; at laſt apprehended the Biſhop himſelf. They had preuailed, if the preſent protection of our B. Lady had not quailed the rage of their enemies. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold as they were about to draw forth their priſoner, they were ſtriken with ſuddaine blindneſſe, and began to wander like blind men. Wheruppon being frighted with the
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:19095:270"/>vndoubted wrath of God puniſhing their wickednes, they let go the veſſell which they had taken, and ſhe holding on her courſe, by fauour of our B. Lady arriued at the deſired harbour, hauing twice in few daies eſcaped theſe exceeding dangers. For which cauſe the Biſhop and his retinew, being very mindefull of their vow, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with from the place where they landed, came to <hi>Loreto</hi> on foote, the yere 1586. where the Biſhop rightly performing his vow, left the whole matter ſet downe in writing in the Houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> in token of the double help of our B.

The chiefeſt of his inheritance was <hi>Falconaria</hi> a rich Farme, which being very fruitfull both for corne and wine, is ſituated moſt conueniently, to wit, not far from <hi>Ancona</hi> and the ſea, that from thence the commodities and fruites may be conueyed to <hi>Loreto</hi> by boate. The whole inheritance, is thought to be worth about three ſcore thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Crownes, which muſt needes be a very great fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to ſupplie all the neceſſities of the Houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> either preſent or to come.

<pb n="499" facs="tcp:19095:278"/>hindered the commodity of her Almes and donaries. For beſides 800.

Lady, ſhe knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe very reuerently, and ſpent many houres deuoutly in prayer: which ſhe did not once onely, but three dayes together for ſo long ſhe remayned at <hi>Loreto.</hi> All which time ſhe was ſo conuerſant in the Church, and attentiue to diuine prayer, that you would haue thought, ſhe had dwelt in the Church. Like magnificence correſponded to theſe tokens of piety.

O good God! what manner
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:19095:286"/>of thing is this! Truly I neuer felt the like vnto this; nor neuer found God more preſent in all my life; ſo doth a certaine heauenly ſweetnes flow into my ſoule, in this moſt ſacred Houſe.

In regard whereof he deſired to grace the moſt Maieſticall Cell of the B. Virgin with ſome gift of his: and hauing brought with him (euen from <hi>China</hi> it ſelf) a white damaske veſtment, with this he determined to beautify the Nicet of the B. Virgin Mother of God, and the Image of Chriſt Crucified, which came with the ſacred houſe. A taylour therfore was ſent for, who ſpreading abroad and meaſuring the damaske, firſt denied that
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:19095:287"/>there was ſtuffe inough for both thoſe purpoſes. But <hi>Sancius</hi> vrging him to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it againe with more diligent care, he ſtaied a while; and when he had often turned it to and fro, he began to affirme, that at laſt he had found a meanes to effect that which he deſired, but ſo, that thoſe ornaments would be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhorter, then was fitting.

               <p>BVT this is not ſo meruailous for the gift it ſelf, as for the euent therof. <hi>Beatrice Gazea</hi> a Matron of great delicacie and riches, was married to a moſt worthy Cittizen of <hi>Rome;</hi> who for deuotion comming to <hi>Loreto</hi> in the moneth of May, the 93. yeare of this age, forthwith went into the inward part of the ſacred Cell, where the moſt religious Image of the B. Virgin of <hi>Loreto,</hi> holding the ſweet child IESVS in her lap, is ſcene and reuerenced neere at hand; which is adorned with a moſt precious garment, and decked in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent ſort. Praying there with feruour to Chriſt and his B. Mother, <hi>Gazea</hi> had a great deſire to behold the countenance and ornature of the B. Virgin with more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And blaming the imperfection of
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:19095:288"/>her ſight, requeſted the keeper (who at that time was <hi>Papyrius</hi> N.) to ſhew her the Image of the Mother of God, more exquiſitly with the light of a torch. He willingly condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended vnto it. For with a burning torch, he ſhewed her the B. Virgin, and at her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty told alſo who gaue all the donaries that were about her. Among the reſt, there was a fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlet of orie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pearle of good bignes and beauty, dedicated to the B. Virgin by a Matron of <hi>Rome,</hi> who being giuen to many delightes and pleaſures, lately departed this life, albeit of a cruell kind of death, yet very Chriſtianlike and godly. <hi>Beatrice</hi> hearing this woman named, and knowing her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly, forthwith burſt into admiration. Behold the cauſe, why ſhe by the grace of the B. Virgin, had ſo godly an end of her delicate life! Then turning to the keeper: And I (ſaid ſhe) would willingly dedicate theſe bracelets (then the which I eſteeme nothing more) to Chriſt and his B. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if I thought that the gift of a wicked woman, would not be vngratefull vnto them. The keeper animated the woman ſeeming too fearfull, ſaying that Chriſt was the Sauiour, and <hi>Marie</hi> the Patroneſſe of the wicked. Wheruppon in continent ſhe pulled of her bracelets made of antique
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:19095:289"/>worke, of iewells and gold, and gaue them to the keeper to be offered to <hi>Ieſus</hi> and his B. mother. And preſently the Keeper tooke a little forke prepared for ſuch vſes, and put theron both the bracelets, to direct them to the moſt ſacred Statua, intending to hang them on the erected ſingers of the right hand of the ſweet child Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, for at that preſent there was no fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a place. But as he was drawing backe the ſticke, he obſerued that one of the bracelets remained on the forke, and that the other hauing paſſed the ſingers of the ſweet child Ieſus, was faſtened on his hand, ſo fitly, that fitter it could not be. A meruailous thing. Though the Keeper ſaw it, yet he thought it might be donne by chance. But afterward put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſticke thither againe nothing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of his place. To hang there alſo the other bracelet, there happened another vndoubted miracle. For by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle drawing the forke towards him, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the gifte remained on the ſame hand of Chriſt, on which he left it, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly he ſaw the bracelett remooued from the right to the left hand (the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den globe which he held in that hand, laid downe in the B.

<pb n="522" facs="tcp:19095:289"/>the ſaid bracelet faſtened theron ſo fitlie and ſo elegantly, that by ſetting of lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, with leiſure and of purpoſe, it could not be done more aptly &amp; ſeemely. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Keeper being ſuddainly ſtroken with a certaine ſacred dread at the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing, ſaid to the woman: And Chriſt himſelfe doth ſhew, that thy gift is very gratefull vnto him; for he hath put both thy bracelets on his owne hands, whiles I was doing another thing. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the woman (heauenly grace aſſiſting her) ſighed; and whether for the riot of her former life, or els for the late token of the diuine beneuole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, in her ſighing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth ſuch aboundance of teares, that the ſighes and ſobs of her weeping, were heard of them that prayed in the other part of the ſacred Chamber.

Wheruppon the houſhold running at the firſt noiſe therof, layd hands on their weapons to help their Maiſter.

When they had cut the fleſh foure waies about the wound in manner of a Croſſe, they aſſaied to pull out the peece of the dagger with pinchers. When that preuailed not, they inuented a new and a paynfull remedy to bring it forth, by beating of his breſt on the contrary ſide, which did much increaſe the moſt bitter payne of the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it ſelf. After the dagger was both beaten and drawne with the pinchers, &amp; mooued nothing at all, they conſtantly pronounced that he could not liue, vnles God tooke mercy on him.

But it chanced that ſuddaine death tooke away the weake child without the Nourſes fault. Who well knowing what danger ſhe was likely to incurre by the father of the Child, a man of fierce diſpoſition, forthwith fled ſecretly to <hi>Loreto,</hi> putting great confidence in the Mother of God. Her hope deceiued her not. For when he ſaw his onely child dead, he was ſo enraged with griefe and wrath, that he began to blaſpheme God and his Saintes, and to ſeeke the Nourſes death. But when ſhe appeared not, he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his wrath on her husband, whome he left for dead, hauing giuen him many dangerous woundes.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Hiſtory of <hi>Loreto</hi> with a ſhort rehearſall of the incredibile Celebrity and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty of the Houſe of <hi>Loreto</hi> it ſelf. There paſſeth no time of the yeare, no moneth, no day, in which the Cell of the moſt B. Virgin is not reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced of many ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers. This co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of piety, is not proper to the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tians</hi> &amp; <hi>Italians,</hi> but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſalpines,</hi> &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that dwell beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ſeas, ſpecially to
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:19095:295"/>
                  <hi>Sclauonians, French</hi> and <hi>Flemings.</hi> Neither do <hi>Spaniards, Portugals, Polonians,</hi> or <hi>Germanes</hi> faile therin. Notwithſtanding two times of the yeare are of ſpeciall reſpect, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and celebrity of all people and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Spring, and the Autumne; wherof to the one, the ſacred Conception of God, to the other, the Birth of the B. Virgin Mother of God, do giue beginning to the ſolemnity. And ech doth continue three moneths; all which time the Houſe of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto</hi> is almoſt dayly honoured with great concourſe of people. For there is no Citty, no Towne, no Village, nor no Streete of the Territory of <hi>Picene,</hi> which doth not yearly in troupes and multitudes, viſit the B. Virgin of <hi>Loreto.</hi> Whoſe example doth inuite the borderers therabout, to wit, of <hi>Abruzzo, Vmbria, Flaminia, Aemilia,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Italy</hi> to deſerue the like praiſe of pietie. Their manner of comming, for the moſt part, is thus. The Sodalities go before, euery one both beautified &amp; diſtinguiſhed with their ſpeciall Enſignes and Banners: Wherof diuers (beſides the Image of Chriſt Crucified) do carry before them the Image of the Mother of God, and of other Saintes excellently repreſented. The moderators of theſe Sodalities, and the Prieſts, with the
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:19095:295"/>muſicke of ech company, be the laſt of the aſſembly. Then follow their Donaries, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Crownets, Chalices, Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dles beſet with money, rich clothing, ſiluer Images of Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp; townes &amp; votiue tables betokening the diuine benefitts, which they haue obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our B. Lady. Many times men like vnto Angells, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo like to the Prophets and Sybills, propheſying of the B. Virgin, are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly placed among them, with other perſons ſingular for the preſentation of their attire. And laſt of all the diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and confuſed multitude of the people, doth many times follow this ſolemnity. In the way, they ſing ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne praiſe to God, to his B. Mother, and to the Saintes by turnes; and when they paſſe by any Citty, they excite the Inhabitants therof, to the religion and reuerence of the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of <hi>Loreto,</hi> by the vertuous example of their piety. But aſſoone as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Houſe of <hi>Loreto</hi> (which is ſeene a far of being ſeated on a hill) forthwith all proſtrate their bodies, and with flowing teares of ioy, ſalute the Mother of God. Then ordering themſelues and going in diſpoſed Companies, they ſing Lytanies and Hymnes. Neither are they
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:19095:296"/>without ſome, who ſpedily put of their clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, to put on ſack-cloth prepared for that purpoſe, &amp; follow their fellowes diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their naked backes. The Prieſts of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto</hi> go in ſurpliſſes to the gate of the Towne, to meete theſe Sodalities of the Pilgrims, &amp; bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the Church with ringing of bells, and Muſicke. When they come to the Porch of the ſacred Houſe, with proſtrate bodies all the Pilgrimes ſalute the B. Virgin, with ſo great feruour and compunction of hart, that they who are preſent, are ſo molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with their deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to weep for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany. But aſſoone as they come into the ſacred Cell of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God ſhyning with torches and lampes, and beginne to behold &amp; view the Image of our B. Lady, it is incredible to ſay, what plaints, what ſighes, what teares, are euery where heard. You would eaſily belieue, that Almighty God himſelf were preſent among them. Further, many are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with ſuch heauenly dread &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted ioy &amp; do ſo adhere to thoſe ſacred walls, that they can ſcarce be pulled and drawne for thence. And whiles with great deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they behold the Altar of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, the ſacred Armory, the dore mured vp, &amp; the chymney, whiles the B. Virgin, doing
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:19095:296"/>any thing in theſe places, doth occurre to the mindes of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that do meditate, they would make no end of beholding, nor no end of kiſſing thoſe ſacred things, if the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of many coueting to do the ſame, did not hinder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This in effect is the manner of the bordering people. But the Pilgrims of forraine Nations, come thither in great troupes, ſome on foote, ſome on horsbacke, or els in Coaches, moſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remarkable in the habit and ſignes of Pilgrimes: Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding their different habit, the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which they vſe to the Houſe of <hi>Loreto,</hi> is the ſelf ſame to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all. This is almoſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, to be fed at the Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Table, after the expiation of their ſinnes: wherof many do enrich the Altar of the B. Virgin with money &amp; precious Donaries. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the worthieſt gifts are vſually deliuered to the Keepers of the ſacred Chappell, that they may be recorded in the bookes of <hi>Lore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> that memory, both of them, &amp; of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers may be knowne to poſterity. The Altar of the Apoſtles, but ſpecially the Image of the Mother of God, is allwaies magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly adorned with iewels &amp; other gifts accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the variety of the time. And the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Chapel it ſelf doth allwayes ſhine with white wax-candles, &amp; many ſiluer lampes;
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:19095:297"/>and for the moſt part ſoundeth continually with Muſicke &amp; inſtruments. And (which is chiefe of all) doth allwaies abound with the preſent grace of Almighty God, which floweth into the hartes of the Pilgrims, that come to viſit it: In ſuch ſort truly, as it repleniſheth the goldy with a certaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted ioy, the wicked with horrour, to the ſicke it giueth remedy, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort to the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, ſpirit to theſlow, aide to the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, health to the forlorne. But the greateſt concourſe to the Chappell of <hi>Loreto</hi> is about Eaſter, Whitſontide, &amp; the Natiuity of the B. Virgin. For beſides others innumerable, which come to <hi>Loreto,</hi> about Eaſter on foote, on horsbacke, or in Coaches, out of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bardy, Venice,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> many come in great multitudes to <hi>Ancona</hi> by ſhipping, whence (for the moſt part) all go afoot to the ſacred Houſe of <hi>Loreto.</hi> And the day after Eaſter (in which is read the Goſpell of the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims going to <hi>Emmaus</hi>) moſt of them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre themſelues in the habit of Pilgrims, &amp; after the Benediction of their Prelates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſet forward by the direction of their Prieſts, the Keepers of Innocency: of which Pilgrims there is ſuch a multitude, as they may happily exceed twelue thouſand: who receiue an incredible concourſe of people
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:19095:297"/>from the adioyning Villages, Townes, and Citties, and oftentimes many and great companies of harueſt folkes and mowers. But ſpecially the Natiuity of our B. Lady is illuſtrated with far greater multitude of ſtrangers; almoſt all <hi>Picene</hi> (to ſay nothing of other Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treys) reſorting to <hi>Loreto.</hi> For it is well knowne, that in thoſe two dayes, aboue two hundred thouſand people came of late to the Houſe of <hi>Loreto:</hi> &amp; therfore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity doth inforce the keepers of the moſt ſacred Chappell, at that time to compaſſe the inward part therof on the outſide with railes, that they may eaſily admit, or exclude whome they will, and keepe of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Likewiſe at all times of the yeare, Bands of ſouldiours and Troupes of Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men going to the war, come to <hi>Loreto,</hi> and when they haue receiued the holy Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they honour the B. Virgin with ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-ſhewes in warlike faſhion. And this incredible confluence of ſtrangers hath made the waies which go to <hi>Loreto</hi> to be moſt frequented with Innes, the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity wherof (ioyned to the commodity of the wayes themſelues) yieldeth no difficult Pilgrimage to footmen, howbeit delicate and feeble. Moreouer the ſayd wayes are ſo much frequented, that diuers troupes of
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:19095:298"/>Pilgrims do euery where meete: which is ſo great an inſtigation to piety, and eaſe of trauell, that <hi>Marcus Antonius Columna</hi> himſelf (to ſay nothing of others) a man famous for riches and warlike affaires, was able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his votiue Pilgrimage to <hi>Loreto</hi> on foote. And in very deed when at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth they come thither, &amp; behold &amp; ſee the Mother of God, all receiue ſo great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of heauenly ioy (Alm. God repleniſhing their godly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes therwith) that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a very great reward, though their Pilgrimage were difficult &amp; paynefull vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What ſhould I heere relate how many make vowes to the B. Virgin? How many performe them? How many come out of the ſinke of wickednes? How many free their ſoules from the vnexplicable ſnares of inceſtuous delectations? How many forget old enmities, and long continued hatreds? How many deſpairing of ſaluation, &amp; <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king league with Hell,</hi> are pulled out of the ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes of Hell it ſelf? For by how much the ſoules are worthier than the bodies; by ſo much, more and greater miracles of the B. Virgin of <hi>Loreto</hi> are manifeſtly ſeene, in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſoules rather than the bodies of men. But becauſe it is the endeauour of man, to explicate by wordes, theſe &amp; other
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:19095:298"/>things which we haue recounted, ſeeming to meaſure the manifold fauours of Alim. God (which do very ſpecially appeare at his beloued <hi>Loreto</hi>) by humane imbecillity; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thinke it fitter to yield to the burden, than to goe about to ſay more of thoſe things, which I ſhould but impayre and leſſen by my diſcourſe. But this I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme, that the Celebrity &amp; Maieſty of <hi>Loreto</hi> is ſo great, as they, who haue not ſeene it with their eyes, can not conceiue it in their mindes: ſo that, if hereafter you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre that which you haue heard, with theſe things which we haue rehearſed, you ſhall find the fame to be much leſſe, than the thing it ſelf. So much by her incredible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty and dignity, doth one <hi>Loreto</hi> on earth, not only ſurpaſſe all credit, but euen very fame it ſelf, which is wont to declare &amp; explicate all things to the vttermoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the greater glory of God, and of our B. Lady of</hi> Loreto.</p>
